npx create-react-app ai-pollution-measure --template typescript
cd ai-pollution-measure





A ScanResult interface that defines what we're measuring:

Bot activity (automated scripts/crawlers)
Resource waste (unnecessary loading/processing)
Tracking level (analytics and tracking scripts)
Spam score (content quality assessment)
Overall pollution score
List of specific issues found
A simulated scanning function that would eventually need to be connected to a real backend service that can:

Crawl the provided URL
Analyze page content and behavior
Check for bot patterns
Measure resource usage
Detect tracking scripts
Identify spam patterns
A results display that shows:

Individual scores for each metric
Total pollution score
Specific issues found
Timestamp of the scan
To make this actually functional, you would need to:

Create a backend service that can safely crawl websites
Implement real detection algorithms for each metric
Add proper error handling and validation
Add rate limiting and security measures
Store scan results in a database
Add more sophisticated analysis tools
Some actual metrics you might want to implement:

Check for hidden links and spam content
Analyze script loading and execution time
Count number of third-party trackers
Detect aggressive pop-ups and notifications
Measure bandwidth usage
Check for cryptomining scripts
Analyze ad density
Check for dark patterns in UI/UX
